DESCRIPTION:
Running run_analisys.R produces the outputfile result_group_by_subject_act.txt which 
contains the following data:

For each subject and each activity, the 'average' (as computed by the 'mean' funtcion R)
of the 'mean' and 'std' measurements from the input data is computed.

The details of the 'mean' and 'std' measurements, refer to the txt files available
in "UCI HAR Dataset/".

COLUMN LIST:
"subjectId"		Test subject identifier
"actName"		Activity name (correponding to the second column in input activity_labels.txt)
"time.BodyAcc.mean.X"	Corresponds to tBodyAcc-mean-()-X in input features.txt.  The rest of the columns below are transformed similarly.
